# Attendance System using OpenCV and Face Recognition
The Attendance System using OpenCV and Face Recognition is a Python application designed to automate attendance tracking by recognizing individuals' faces in real-time. The system utilizes OpenCV for image processing and face recognition techniques to identify employees or students and mark their attendance.

# Workflow Overview
### Data Collection and Preparation:
The system collects a dataset of facial images for each individual whose attendance needs to be tracked.
Each image is labeled with the corresponding individual's name.
### Face Detection and Recognition:
OpenCV is used to detect faces in real-time video frames captured from the camera.
Face recognition algorithms compare the detected faces with the stored dataset to identify individuals.
### Attendance Marking:
Upon successful recognition of a face, the system records the individual's name, timestamp, and date in an attendance record.
# Getting Started
To set up and run the Attendance System:
1. Install OpenCV and necessary Python dependencies.
2.Prepare a dataset of facial images labeled with individual names.
3. Implement face recognition and attendance marking functionality using the provided Python script.
4. Run the Python script to start the attendance system.
# Key Features
1. Real-time face detection and recognition using OpenCV.
2. Automatic marking of attendance upon successful face recognition.
3. Minimal setup required to start tracking attendance using a camera.
# How to Use
1. Clone the repository containing the Python script and dataset.
2. Ensure that Python and OpenCV are properly installed on your system.
3. Run the Python script to initialize the attendance system.
4. Position the camera to capture individuals' faces in the frame.
5. The system will detect and recognize faces, marking attendance accordingly.
